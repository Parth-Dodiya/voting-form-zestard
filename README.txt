Here is a short description of the plugin.

== Description ==

This is the Voting form plugin.  It is developed for Zestard Technologies for prctical round in interview process.

This plugin is stand-alone plugin, it does not require any other plugin to run it. It only tested with classic themes, not block themes. But I think it will work with them as well.

THis plugin is developed on shortcode functionality. Use [voting_form] shortcode to display the form on front-end side. Instructions regarding the form has been followed like image selection, form fields. Also, Validation is take care in it. Validation is managed on client-side. 

Results can be seen in admin side from Users menu > Voted User sub-menu. WP_List_Table used to display the voting result.
